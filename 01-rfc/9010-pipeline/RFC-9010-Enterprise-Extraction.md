RFC-9010: Enterprise Information Research and Extraction (Cleaned)

Same idea as your draft, but stripped of ROI/money talk and anchored to SX9 Core.

Sections

Overview & Relationship to SX9 Core

This RFC as a practice on top of SX9 Core

Explicit reference to RFC-9000-Core

Conceptual Model

CTAS task graph → PTCC 33 → SX9 primitives

Six-dimensional cognitive vector A = (P, T, E, S, R, Φ)

“Enterprise” here = any domain using SX9 extraction

Multi-Modal Analytical Harness

CTAS task graph analysis (164 terrorist tasks as canonical adversarial corpus)

PTCC 33 primitives: cross-domain pattern validation

OntoGPT/SPIRES ontology extraction

BNE research/QA harness

On-Ramps (Input Modalities)

Cognigraph capture (expert session)

Document/Voice ingestion

Existing research corpora

Ontology-first requirement (always go through SX9 ontology layer)

Off-Ramps (Output Modalities)

Automation blueprints / executable specifications

Training environments (simulation, Cognigraph, CTAS)

Pattern libraries (reusable cognitive assets)

Adversarial Validation Pipeline

CTAS task mapping as red-team perspective

HD4 phase mapping

Intelligence-grade evaluation criteria

Technical Integration

EnterpriseAnalyticalHarness interface (TS/Rust neutrality)

Required calls into:

Ontology engine

PTCC validator

Hash subsystem

Storage layers

Quality & Academic Validation

Prior-art check (Zotero/GNN)

Performance testing (Rust harness)

Cross-domain applicability tests

Success Metrics (Non-ROI)

Accuracy retention

Pattern stability

Cross-domain reuse rate

False-positive / false-negative rates in mapping

Security & Compliance Hooks

Where enterprise-specific law/reg compliance is attached

Use of zero-trust and capability tags (references security RFC)
