# RFC-9307
## Matroid-Constrained Selection Framework

Status: Draft

Independence:
- Partition matroids (city, source, action_type)
- Laminar matroids (geo, time)

Objective:
Maximize weighted submodular score.

Algorithm:
Deterministic greedy selection.

Rank:
Matroid rank is a convergence signal.
