# CTAS v7.3.1 Documentation Index

**Generated:** November 10, 2025 at 00:14
**Commit:** 84eed27

## Recent Changes
docs(architecture): Add comprehensive documentation for node interviews, GEE ground stations, and intel extraction

- NODE-CRATE-INTERVIEWS.md: Complete documentation of 165 node/crate interview system
  * First-person adversary narratives for all 165 CTAS tasks
  * EEI (Essential Elements of Information) requirements
  * N-DEx/NIEM integration for law enforcement interoperability
  * Convergence Meter and intelligence collection pipeline
  * Time-of-value analysis and ephemeral intelligence rules
  * Integration with PLASMA, Neural Mux, Foundation v7.3.1

- GEE-GROUND-STATIONS.md: Google Earth Engine and 257 ground station architecture
  * LaserLight FSO ground station placement optimization
  * GEE atmospheric analysis for FSO link suitability
  * Submarine cable landings and critical infrastructure extraction
  * Universal KMZ layering system (Mapbox/Cesium/GEE compatible)
  * Trivariate hashing and USIM integration for GIS layers
  * Ground stations as Legion ECS entities with SlotGraph coordination

- INTEL-EXTRACTION-SYSTEM.md: Complete intelligence extraction crate documentation
  * 7-crate Rust workspace for OSINT collection (6,474+ sources)
  * Pure regex IOC extraction (IPs, domains, hashes, CVEs)
  * Multi-stage pipeline: deterministic → LoRA Phi-3 → Crawl4AI → O3
  * Integration with MISP, SurrealDB, Supabase
  * EEI-driven collection feeding 165-node graph detector
  * Performance benchmarks and deployment guides

Architecture:
- Node interviews define WHAT adversaries do (TTPs, indicators, EEI)
- Crate interviews define WHAT SYSTEMS are needed (escalation ladder)
- GEE extracts WHERE (optimal ground station locations, infrastructure)
- Intel system collects HOW (OSINT scraping, IOC extraction, storage)

Integration:
- 247 WASM microkernels at ground stations feed graph detector
- Node interview EEIs drive intelligence collection requirements
- Convergence Meter uses Foundation math (KNN, A*, Matroid) for prediction
- Multi-stage pipeline optimizes cost (deterministic first, AI last)

Next: Deploy CDN Statistical Service, integrate with PLASMA dashboard
